## About the Book

Learn how to create text-based user interfaces (TUIs) using Python and the amazing Textual package.

Textual is a rapid application development framework for your terminal or web browser. You can build complex, sophisticated applications in your terminal. While terminal applications are text-based rather than pixel-based, they still provide fantastic user interfaces.

The Textual package allows you to create widgets in your terminal that mimic those used in a web or GUI application.

Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python is to teach you how to use Textual to make striking applications of your own. The book's first half will teach you everything you need to know to develop a terminal application.

The book's second half has many small applications you will learn how to create. Each chapter also includes challenges to complete to help cement what you learn or give you ideas for continued learning.

Here are some of the applications you will create:

- A basic calculator
- A CSV viewer
- A Text Editor
- An MP3 player
- An ID3 Editor
- A Weather application
- A TUI for pre-commit
- An RSS Reader
